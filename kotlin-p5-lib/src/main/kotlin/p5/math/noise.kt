/**
 * Returns the Perlin noise value at specified coordinates. Perlin noise is
 * a random sequence generator producing a more naturally ordered, harmonic
 * succession of numbers compared to the standard <a href="#/p5/random">random()</a> function.
 * It was invented by Ken Perlin in the 1980s and been used since in
 * graphical applications to produce procedural textures, natural motion,
 * shapes, terrains etc.<br /><br /> The main difference to the
 * <a href="#/p5/random">random()</a> function is that Perlin noise is defined in an infinite
 * n-dimensional space where each pair of coordinates corresponds to a
 * fixed semi-random value (fixed only for the lifespan of the program; see
 * the <a href="#/p5/noiseSeed">noiseSeed()</a> function). p5.js can compute 1D, 2D and 3D noise,
 * depending on the number of coordinates given. The resulting value will
 * always be between 0.0 and 1.0. The noise value can be animated by moving
 * through the noise space as demonstrated in the example above. The 2nd
 * and 3rd dimensions can also be interpreted as time.<br /><br />The actual
 * noise is structured similar to an audio signal, in respect to the
 * function's use of frequencies. Similar to the concept of harmonics in
 * physics, Perlin noise is computed over several octaves which are added
 * together for the final result. <br /><br />Another way to adjust the
 * character of the resulting sequence is the scale of the input
 * coordinates. As the function works within an infinite space the value of
 * the coordinates doesn't matter as such, only the distance between
 * successive coordinates does (e.g. when using <a href="#/p5/noise">noise()</a> within a
 * loop). As a general rule the smaller the difference between coordinates,
 * the smoother the resulting noise sequence will be. Steps of 0.005-0.03
 * work best for most applications, but this will differ depending on use.

 * @method noise
 * @param  {Number} [x] x-coordinate in noise space
 * @param  {Number} [y] y-coordinate in noise space
 * @param  {Number} [z] z-coordinate in noise space
 * @return {Number}     Perlin noise value (between 0 and 1) at specified
 *                      coordinates
 * @example
 * <div>
 * <code>
 * let xoff = 0.0;

 * function draw() {
 *   background(204);

/**
 * Adjusts the character and level of detail produced by the Perlin noise
 * function. Similar to harmonics in physics, noise is computed over
 * several octaves. Lower octaves contribute more to the output signal and
 * as such define the overall intensity of the noise, whereas higher octaves
 * create finer-grained details in the noise sequence.
 *
 * By default, noise is computed over 4 octaves with each octave contributing
 * exactly half as much as its predecessor, starting at 50% strength for the 1st
 * octave. This falloff amount can be changed by adding a function
 * parameter. E.g. a falloff factor of 0.75 means each octave will now have
 * 75% impact (25% less) of the previous lower octave. Any value between
 * 0.0 and 1.0 is valid, however, note that values greater than 0.5 might
 * result in greater than 1.0 values returned by <a href="#/p5/noise">noise()</a>.
 *
 * By changing these parameters, the signal created by the <a href="#/p5/noise">noise()</a>
 * function can be adapted to fit very specific needs and characteristics.
 *
 * @method noiseDetail
 * @param {Number} [lod] number of octaves to be used by the noise
 * @param {Number} [falloff] falloff factor for each octave
